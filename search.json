If you have no experience using R (or any other programming language), you are still welcome to join the course. Just keep in mind that the learning curve will steeper for you and you will need to set aside sufficient time to get up-to-speed with the programming skills required to be successful in the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMandatory R course\n\n\n\nAll students should complete the R Advanced for Methodology Preparatory Course before the end of Week 1 of the Autumn Term. If you already have advanced R skills (covering all the modules in the preparatory course), then you do not need to complete it.\n\n\nDuring the first lecture, we will provide a link to complete a course on-boarding survey."

Any recent laptop running macOS or Windows with at least 8 GB of RAM should be sufficient, but please email the course convenor if you are unsure. Also, if you are considering purchasing a new laptop and want some advice, feel free to contact the course convenor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimum hardware requirements\n\n\n\nYou will not be able to use a tablet or iPad for the work in this course. You also might not be able to use a very old laptop or one with minimal technical specifications, such as some Chromebooks.\n\n\nMost of the materials in this course have been developed on Apple’s macOS, and the lectures and seminars will be primarily taught with Apple laptops. In our experience, Apple computers are the most commonly used for data science in academia and in industry. You may use other operating systems (Windows or Linux), but please be aware that we make no guarantees about the seamless interoperability of the course materials across all operating systems and/or all computers.\nWe expect students to install R and Positron on their computers, in addition to other software as necessary. You can install R from https://www.r-project.org/ and Positron from https://positron.posit.co/.\nAll students should create a GitHub account (if they have not already), and sign up for GitHub Education benefits. See https://github.com/education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical requirements for in-person assessment\n\n\n\nDetails about the technical requirements for the in-person practical test will be announced during the term."

We expect that will communicate with us via your LSE email address or the course Slack workspace. Please do not send us emails from personal email accounts.\nWhich instructor should I contact? For general course-related questions, you should contact the course convenor, Ryan Hübert. If you have specific questions about your seminar, you may contact your seminar instructors.\nWhich topics are appropriate for electronic messages? Please reserve your electronic messaging for short logistical questions that are easy for us to answer quickly. If you have more involved questions about course content, please sign up for office hours.\nHow should I write my messages? Please keep your messages to the instructors brief, clear, direct and professional. Do not send us excessively long emails written by an LLM. While it is rare, instructors sometimes receive messages that are rude, hostile or otherwise unprofessional. In these instances, we may either ignore your message or ask that you attend an in-person meeting to discuss how to improve your communication."
