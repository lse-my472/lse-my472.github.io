Also, if you are considering purchasing a new laptop and want some advice, feel free to contact the course convenor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimum hardware requirements\n\n\n\nYou will not be able to use a tablet or iPad for the work in this course. You also might not be able to use a very old laptop or one with minimal technical specifications, such as some Chromebooks.\n\n\nMost of the materials in this course have been developed on Apple’s macOS, and the lectures and seminars will be primarily taught with Apple laptops. In our experience, Apple computers are the most commonly used for data science in academia and in industry. You may use other operating systems (Windows or Linux), but please be aware that we make no guarantees about the seamless interoperability of the course materials across all operating systems and/or all computers.\nWe expect students to install R and Positron on their computers, in addition to other software as necessary. You can install R from https://www.r-project.org/ and Positron from https://positron.posit.co/.\nAll students should create a GitHub account (if they have not already), and sign up for GitHub Education benefits. See https://github.com/education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical requirements for in-person assessment\n\n\n\nDetails about the technical requirements for the in-person practical test will be announced during the term."

Please reserve your electronic messaging for short logistical questions that are easy for us to answer quickly. If you have more involved questions about course content, please sign up for office hours.\nHow should I write my messages? Please keep your messages to the instructors brief, clear, direct and professional. Do not send us excessively long emails written by an LLM.
