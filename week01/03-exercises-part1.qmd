## Exercise 1: getting set up

**Before you do anything:** if you have not completed the onboarding survey, please do so now at <https://forms.office.com/e/vyaBW1D6mu>.

If you haven't already, please:

- install R from <https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/>
- install Positron from <https://positron.posit.co/>
- set up your GitHub account
- install Git

For additional details on how to do this, please refer to the other seminar materials for the week.

## Exercise 2: basic command line

For this exercise, you will work in your computer's command line. macOS users should use the Terminal app and Windows users should use PowerShell. Complete the following steps.

- Open your command line application, and make sure you are in your home directory. If you are not, then use the appropriate command to change to the home directory.

- Create a new folder called `LSE-MY472-AT25` using the appropriate command. 

- Now that you have created this new directory, navigate to it using the appropriate command and using a _relative_ directory path.

- Now print the current working directory using the appropriate command. 

- Navigate to your Desktop using an absolute directory path and the appropriate command.

- Once your command line is at this directory, find out how many files and subdirectories are on your desktop by using the command `ls -1 | wc -l` in Terminal and `(dir . | measure).Count;` in Powershell. (If the number is high, ask yourself: is your Desktop messy, cluttered or disorganised?)

- Save a copy of your entire command line output to a text file called `Seminar01_CommandLine1.txt`. Save the file into your new `LSE-MY472-AT25` directory. You can do this as follows:

    - In Terminal (macOS): using the menu option `Shell > Export Text As...`, or pressing `Command(⌘)+S`
    - In PowerShell (Windows): right click the tab at the top and select `Export text`

- Quit your command line application.

## Exercise 3: Git and GitHub

In this exercise, you will create a repository on GitHub, clone it to you computer, and track some modifications.

- While logged into your GitHub account in a webbrowser, create a private repository called `Seminar01`.

- Open your computer's command line and then navigate to the `LSE-MY472-AT25` directory you created in the previous exercise, using the appropriate command. For this exercise, use an absolute path.

- Once your command line is in the `LSE-MY472-AT25` directory, clone your `Seminar01` repository into this directory using the appropriate `git` command. 
    
    - If you have never authenticated to GitHub on your command line, you will be prompted for username and password. Please review the guidance in the document `02-git-setup.qmd`.

- After doing this, open the `README.md` file and add today's date and your LSE candidate ID somewhere inside the document. Save and close it.

- Switch back over to your command line, and navigate to the `Seminar01` repo folder using the appropriate command, then print your working directory.

- Check the status of your files in the repo by using the appropriate `git` command. 

- Now, put a copy of each of this week's seminar code (i.e., all the `.qmd` files) into the directory for your `Seminar01` repo. Again check the status of the files in the repo by using the appropriate `git` command. 

- Log all the changes you have made to files in your repo by staging each file one-by-one and by committing them. When you commit, use a brief but informative message. 

- Sync your changes to remote (GitHub) using the appropriate `git` command.

- Check the full log of this repo using the appropriate `git` command in the command line.

- Save a copy of your command line output to a text file called `Seminar01_CommandLine2.txt`, following instructions in a previous exercise. You should save this file into your `Seminar01` repository, after which you should stage, commit and push it.

- Quit your command line application.

## Exercise 4: launching a working directory in Positron

- Open the Positron app, and then in the "File" menu select "Open Folder...". 

- Find your "Seminar01" folder and open it.

- Open the EXPLORER panel in Positron in the "View" menu, or by either (1) using the keyboard shortcut `Shift+Command(⌘)+E` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+E` (Windows), or (2) clicking the icon on the top left that looks like:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| out.width: "10%"
#| fig.align: "center"
knitr::include_graphics("Positron-Explorer.png")
```

- In the file tree that appears on the left, find the file `03-exercises-part2.qmd` and click to open it.
