Thanks to [dplyr tutorial](https://github.com/justmarkham/dplyr-tutorial/blob/master/dplyr-tutorial.Rmd) by [Kevin Markham](https://github.com/justmarkham)

Note: There is a 40-minute [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWjqLW-u3hc) on YouTube that walks through this document in detail.

## Why using dplyr?

* Great for data exploration and transformation
* Intuitive to write and easy to read, especially when using the "chaining" syntax (covered below)
* Fast on data frames


## dplyr functionality

* Five basic verbs: `filter`, `select`, `arrange`, `mutate`, `summarise` (plus `group_by`)
* Can work with data stored in databases and [data tables](http://datatable.r-forge.r-project.org/)

## Loading dplyr and an example dataset

* dplyr will mask a few base functions
* hflights is flights departing from two Houston airports in 2011

```{r}
# load packages
suppressMessages(library(dplyr))
library(hflights)

# explore data
data(hflights)
head(hflights)
```

* `tbl_df` creates a "local data frame"
* Local data frame is simply a wrapper for a data frame that prints nicely

```{r}
# convert to local data frame
flights <- tbl_df(hflights)
```

## `filter`: Keep rows matching criteria

* Base R approach to filtering forces you to repeat the data frame's name
* dplyr approach is simpler to write and read
* Command structure (for all dplyr verbs):
    * first argument is a data frame
    * return value is a data frame
    * nothing is modified in place
* Note: dplyr generally does not preserve row names

```{r results='hide'}
# base R approach to view all flights on January 1
flights[flights$Month==1 & flights$DayofMonth==1, ]
```

```{r}
# dplyr approach
# note: you can use comma or ampersand to represent AND condition
filter(flights, Month==1, DayofMonth==1)

# use pipe for OR condition
filter(flights, UniqueCarrier=="AA" | UniqueCarrier=="UA")
```

## `select`: Pick columns by name

* Base R approach is awkward to type and to read
* dplyr approach uses similar syntax to `filter`

```{r results='hide'}
# base R approach to select DepTime, ArrTime, and FlightNum columns
flights[, c("DepTime", "ArrTime", "FlightNum")]
```

```{r}
# dplyr approach
select(flights, c(DepTime, ArrTime, FlightNum))

# use colon to select multiple contiguous columns, and use `contains` to match columns by name
# note: `starts_with`, `ends_with`, and `matches` (for regular expressions) can also be used to match columns by name
select(flights, c(Year:DayofMonth, contains("Taxi"), contains("Delay")))
```


## `%>%`: "Chaining" or "Pipelining"

* Usual way to perform multiple operations in one line is by nesting
* Can write commands in a natural order by using the `%>%` infix operator (which can be pronounced as "then")

```{r results='hide'}
# nesting method to select UniqueCarrier and DepDelay columns and filter for delays over 60 minutes
filter(select(flights, c(UniqueCarrier, DepDelay)), DepDelay > 60)
```

```{r}
# chaining method
flights %>%
    select(c(UniqueCarrier, DepDelay)) %>%
    filter(DepDelay > 60)
```

* Chaining increases readability significantly when there are many commands
* Operator is automatically imported from the [magrittr](https://github.com/smbache/magrittr) package
* Can be used to replace nesting in R commands outside of dplyr

```{r results='hide'}
# create two vectors and calculate Euclidian distance between them
x1 <- 1:5
x2 <- 2:6
sqrt(sum((x1-x2)^2))
```

```{r}
# chaining method
(x1-x2)^2 %>% sum() %>% sqrt()
```


## `mutate`: Add or alter variables

* Create new variables that are functions of existing variables

```{r results='hide'}
# base R approach to create a new variable Speed (in mph)
flights$Speed <- flights$Distance / flights$AirTime*60
flights[, c("Distance", "AirTime", "Speed")]
```

```{r}
# dplyr approach (prints the new variable but does not store it)
flights %>%
    select(Distance, AirTime) %>%
    mutate(Speed = Distance/AirTime*60)

# store the new variable
flights <- flights %>% mutate(Speed = Distance/AirTime*60)
```


## Additional 

### `arrange`: Reorder rows

```{r results='hide'}
# base R approach to select UniqueCarrier and DepDelay columns and sort by DepDelay
flights[order(flights$DepDelay), c("UniqueCarrier", "DepDelay")]
```

```{r}
# dplyr approach
flights %>%
    select(UniqueCarrier, DepDelay) %>%
    arrange(DepDelay)
```

```{r results='hide'}
# use `desc` for descending
flights %>%
    select(UniqueCarrier, DepDelay) %>%
    arrange(desc(DepDelay))
```

### `summarise`: Reduce variables to values

* Primarily useful with data that has been grouped by one or more variables
* `group_by` creates the groups that will be operated on
* `summarise` uses the provided aggregation function to summarise each group

```{r results='hide'}
# base R approaches to calculate the average arrival delay to each destination
head(with(flights, tapply(ArrDelay, Dest, mean, na.rm=TRUE)))
head(aggregate(ArrDelay ~ Dest, flights, mean))
```

```{r}
# dplyr approach: create a table grouped by Dest, and then summarise each group by taking the mean of ArrDelay
flights %>%
    group_by(Dest) %>%
    summarise(avg_delay = mean(ArrDelay, na.rm=TRUE))
```

* `summarise_each` allows you to apply the same summary function to multiple columns at once
* Note: `mutate_each` is also available

```{r}
# for each carrier, calculate the percentage of flights cancelled or diverted
flights %>%
    group_by(UniqueCarrier) %>%
    summarise_each(funs(mean), Cancelled, Diverted)

# for each carrier, calculate the minimum and maximum arrival and departure delays
flights %>%
    group_by(UniqueCarrier) %>%
    summarise_each(funs(min(., na.rm=TRUE), max(., na.rm=TRUE)), matches("Delay"))
```

* Helper function `n()` counts the number of rows in a group
* Helper function `n_distinct(vector)` counts the number of unique items in that vector

```{r}
# for each day of the year, count the total number of flights and sort in descending order
flights %>%
    group_by(Month, DayofMonth) %>%
    summarise(flight_count = n()) %>%
    arrange(desc(flight_count))

# rewrite more simply with the `tally` function
flights %>%
    group_by(Month, DayofMonth) %>%
    tally(sort = TRUE)

# for each destination, count the total number of flights and the number of distinct planes that flew there
flights %>%
    group_by(Dest) %>%
    summarise(flight_count = n(), plane_count = n_distinct(TailNum))
```

* Grouping can sometimes be useful without summarising

```{r}
# for each destination, show the number of cancelled and not cancelled flights
flights %>%
    group_by(Dest) %>%
    select(Cancelled) %>%
    table() %>%
    head()
```


### Window Functions

* Aggregation function (like `mean`) takes n inputs and returns 1 value
* [Window function](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/window-functions.html) takes n inputs and returns n values
    * Includes ranking and ordering functions (like `min_rank`), offset functions (`lead` and `lag`), and cumulative aggregates (like `cummean`).

```{r results='hide'}
# for each carrier, calculate which two days of the year they had their longest departure delays
# note: smallest (not largest) value is ranked as 1, so you have to use `desc` to rank by largest value
flights %>%
    group_by(UniqueCarrier) %>%
    select(Month, DayofMonth, DepDelay) %>%
    filter(min_rank(desc(DepDelay)) <= 2) %>%
    arrange(UniqueCarrier, desc(DepDelay))
```

```{r}
# rewrite more simply with the `top_n` function
flights %>%
    group_by(UniqueCarrier) %>%
    select(Month, DayofMonth, DepDelay) %>%
    top_n(2) %>%
    arrange(UniqueCarrier, desc(DepDelay))

# for each month, calculate the number of flights and the change from the previous month
flights %>%
    group_by(Month) %>%
    summarise(flight_count = n()) %>%
    mutate(change = flight_count - lag(flight_count))

# rewrite more simply with the `tally` function
flights %>%
    group_by(Month) %>%
    tally() %>%
    mutate(change = n - lag(n))
```


### Other Useful Convenience Functions

```{r}
# randomly sample a fixed number of rows, without replacement
flights %>% sample_n(5)

# randomly sample a fraction of rows, with replacement
flights %>% sample_frac(0.25, replace=TRUE)

# base R approach to view the structure of an object
str(flights)

# dplyr approach: better formatting, and adapts to your screen width
glimpse(flights)
```
