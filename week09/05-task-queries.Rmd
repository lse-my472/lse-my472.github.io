# Querying a SQL database

Practice writing SQL queries that answer the following questions using the database we created in lecture:

1. Who wrote the post that was shared the most times during this period? What does it say?

```{r}
library(DBI)
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "data/facebook-db.sqlite")

dbGetQuery(db, 
           "SELECT screen_name, message
           ...")

```

2. What about the post with the most comments?

```{r}


```

3. Which was the post that received the most likes in January of 2017?

```{r}


```

4. What was the photo posted by a Member of Congress that received the most "angry" reactions?

```{r}

```

5. What was the post by `senatorsanders` that received the most "angry" reactions? And the most "love" reactions?

6. Which was the post mentioning "Trump" that was shared the most? And which was the post that received the most "love" reactions?
